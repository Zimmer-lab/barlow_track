# Training a BarlowTrack network

This folder serves as a training project folder, organizing the parameters and dataset used for training.

## Folder Structure

The `barlow_project_template` directory is organized as follows:

```
barlow_project_template/
├── log/                                  # Output logs
├── checkpoints/                          # Output checkpoints
├── train_config.yaml                     # Configuration file for experiments
├── README.md                             # The file you are reading now
└── hyperparameter_search_template.yaml    # Template for searching through hyperparameters, if used
```

## Training overview

To start, you need:
1. A working conda environment
2. To clone this repository (for helper scripts)
3. A dataset in the Neurodata Without Borders file format
4. Alternate file format: wbfm folder structure (recommended for Zimmer lab legacy datasets only)

Copy the 'barlow_project_template' folder to the desired location then change the parameters in the config file as desired.
Next, you have two options: running it locally or on a cluster.
Either way, a modern gpu is highly recommended.

Note that the amount of memory used scales with the size of the crops used (target_sz_xy and target_sz_z) and number of objects detected.

### Training locally

```
conda activate MY_ENV
cd /path/to/this/repo
python barlow_track/scripts/train_barlow_clusterer.py -p /path/to/train_config.yaml
```

### Training on a cluster

```
conda activate MY_ENV
cd /path/to/this/repo
sbatch barlow_track/scripts/sbatch_train_barlow_clusterer.sbatch -p /path/to/train_config.yaml
```

Important note: this will use a HARDCODED PATH to a script to run the actual training (the .py file in the previous section).
For general use (not Zimmer lab), you must update this!


### Final output

This will produce output in the log/ and checkpoints/ folders, as well as the following in the main folder:
1. resnet50.pth - the final trained weights (this will be used when tracking)
2. args.pickle  - the hyperparameters for training; also needed for reading the network

## Zimmer lab specifics

If you are in the zimmer lab, you can add your trained network folder here:

'/lisc/data/scratch/neurobiology/zimmer/wbfm/TrainedBarlow'


### Alternate training: multiple networks with hyperparameter search

Note that this is not needed for most workflows with data similar to the worm baseline; in that case, the defaults are good.
From the barlow_project_template folder, make a parent folder with the hyperparameter_search_template.yaml file, and modify it to set which parameters to vary.
Optionally, set alternative defaults by also including a train_config.yaml file (this is required if you want to use wandb).
Then run:

```
conda activate MY_ENV
cd /path/to/this/repo
python barlow_track/scripts/optimize_hyperparameters.py -p /path/to/hyperparameter_search_template.yaml
```

By default this runs on a cluster, thus you may want to run it in a tmux session.
The python script will submit batch jobs (default: 30), and search through parameters to find the best loss.

This will create a series of nested folders in the parent folder, which are all copies of this single-project folder.
They are named trial_N, with the actually used hyperparameters saved in their individual train_config.yaml files.
Finally, the best parameters and trial are saved to "best_parameters.yaml" in the parent folder.
