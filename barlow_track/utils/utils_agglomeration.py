"""
HDBSCAN condensed-tree agglomeration with strict time-purity metric.

Inputs (provided by you / earlier pipeline):
- clusterer: a fitted hdbscan.HDBSCAN object (after clusterer.fit(X) )
- linear_ind_to_t_and_seg_id: dict mapping linear_index -> (t, seg_id, other_id)
    - only the 't' is used here; linear_index is the row index in your original
      embedding / feature matrix
- time_index_to_linear_feature_indices: dict mapping t -> list[linear_index]
    - inverse of the above mapping
- (optional) min_kept_size: minimum number of points required for an accepted cluster

Outputs:
- accepted_clusters: list of dicts describing each accepted merged cluster:
    {'node_id': <condensed-tree node id>,
     'raw_indices': set(...),         # raw indices (all leaves under node)
     'kept_indices': set(...),        # indices kept after enforcing strict one-per-time
     'purity': float }                # purity = len(kept_indices) / len(raw_indices)
- assigned_index_to_cluster: dict mapping linear_index -> accepted_cluster_idx
- outliers: set of linear indices marked as outliers because they lost same-time collisions


Example usage:
accepted_clusters, assigned_map, outliers = agglomerate_by_time_purity(
    clusterer=clusterer,
    linear_ind_to_t_and_seg_id=linear_ind_to_t_and_seg_id,
    time_index_to_linear_feature_indices=time_index_to_linear_feature_indices,
    min_kept_size=2
)

After running you can inspect:
- how many clusters were accepted: len(accepted_clusters)
- distribution of purity: [c['purity'] for c in accepted_clusters]
- unassigned points (neither assigned nor outlier) = set(range(n_points)) - assigned_map.keys() - outliers

    Main function to run the greedy, time-seeded agglomeration over the HDBSCAN condensed tree.

    Strategy implemented:
    - Build condensed tree graph and map every node -> set of leaf point indices under it.
    - Iterate over timepoints (seed order: shuffled deterministically when `seed` is set).
    - For each point index at that timepoint:
        - Ascend the condensed tree from that point (point node id) and consider each ancestor node
          (candidate cluster = all leaves under that ancestor).
        - Compute time-purity for candidate cluster (kept indices after de-duplication).
        - Select the ancestor that yields the highest goodness, where
          ``goodness = purity * coverage``. Candidates must also satisfy
          ``purity >= min_purity`` and ``max_temporal_gap <= max_temporal_gap`` so that
          merges of distinct (co-existing or temporally disjoint) neurons are rejected.
        - Accept the candidate *only if*:
            * goodness is strictly > current best goodness for that specific seed (by eps_increase), and
            * none of kept_indices are already assigned to an accepted cluster or marked as
              outliers (we keep a strict partition).
          If any kept_index already taken, the candidate is skipped to avoid index re-use.
        - Upon acceptance: add an accepted_cluster record; mark kept indices as assigned; mark
          the other raw indices in the candidate (those not in kept_indices) as outliers.
    - Return accepted clusters, assigned map, and outliers set.

    Notes:
    - This greedy approach is deterministic given deterministic traversal order and ties rules
      (set `seed` to an int; `seed=None` restores legacy non-deterministic shuffling).
    - You can easily change the seeding order (e.g., based on within-timepoint cluster quality).
